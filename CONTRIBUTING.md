### 2. Create a Branch
```bash
# Always branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

```

### Branch Naming Conventions
- **Features**: `feature/feature-name`
- **Bug Fixes**: `fix/bug-description`

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add social media monitoring dashboard"
```

### Commit Message Format
Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding tests

## üíª Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- **Use TypeScript** for all new code
- **Strict mode**: Enable strict type checking
- **No `any`**: Use proper types instead of `any`
- **Interfaces**: Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- **Type safety**: Ensure proper type inference

```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad
const handleSubmit = (data: any) => {
  // ...
}

// ‚úÖ Good
interface SubmitData {
  email: string;
  password: string;
}

const handleSubmit = (data: SubmitData) => {
  // ...
}
```

### React Best Practices
- **Functional components**: Use hooks, not class components
- **Custom hooks**: Extract reusable logic into hooks
- **Component size**: Keep components small and focused
- **Props typing**: Always type component props
- **Key props**: Use stable, unique keys in lists

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good component structure
interface UserCardProps {
  user: User;
  onEdit: (userId: string) => void;
}

export const UserCard: React.FC<UserCardProps> = ({ user, onEdit }) => {
  // Component logic
  return (
    // JSX
  );
};
```

### File Organization
- **One component per file** (with its types)
- **Group related files** in directories
- **Index exports**: Use index files for clean imports
- **Naming conventions**:
  - Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
  - Hooks: `useCamelCase.ts`
  - Utils: `camelCase.ts`
  - Types: `PascalCase.ts` or inline

### CSS and Styling
- **Use Tailwind CSS** utility classes
- **Semantic tokens**: Use design system colors
- **No inline styles** unless absolutely necessary
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Dark mode**: Support both themes

```tsx
// ‚ùå Bad: Direct colors
<div className="bg-blue-500 text-white">

// ‚úÖ Good: Semantic tokens
<div className="bg-primary text-primary-foreground">
```

### Code Quality
- **DRY principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself
- **SOLID principles**: Follow object-oriented design principles
- **Descriptive names**: Use clear, meaningful variable/function names
- **Comments**: Document complex logic, not obvious code
- **Error handling**: Always handle errors gracefully
- **Loading states**: Show feedback for async operations

### ESLint and Formatting
- Follow the project's ESLint configuration
- Format code before committing
- Run linter: `npm run lint`
- Auto-fix issues: `npm run lint:fix`

## üîí Security Guidelines

### Critical Rules
1. **Never commit secrets**
   - No API keys in code
   - No passwords or tokens
   - Use environment variables
   - Add sensitive files to `.gitignore`

2. **Validate all inputs**
   - Sanitize user input
   - Use Zod for validation
   - Check for XSS vulnerabilities
   - Prevent SQL injection

3. **Implement proper RLS**
   - All tables must have RLS policies
   - Test policies thoroughly
   - Never expose sensitive data
   - Use admin checks server-side only

4. **Authentication security**
   - Never check roles client-side
   - Always verify on server/database
   - Use secure session management
   - Implement proper password requirements

### Security Checklist
Before submitting code that touches security:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] RLS policies tested
- [ ] No client-side role checks
- [ ] Error messages don't leak info
- [ ] Audit logs for sensitive operations
- [ ] Rate limiting considered
- [ ] XSS prevention applied

### Reporting Security Issues
**DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Contact maintainers privately with:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

npm test -- UserDashboard.test.tsx

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Types of Tests
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/components
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **E2E Tests**: Test complete user flows
4. **Manual Testing**: Always test in browser

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests for utilities
- [ ] Component rendering tests

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation
- **Comment complex logic**: Explain why, not what
- **JSDoc for functions**: Document public APIs
- **Type annotations**: Let types be documentation
- **README updates**: Update when adding major features

### Examples
```typescript
/**
 * Validates and sanitizes user input for deep search
 * @param query - Raw search query from user
 * @param type - Type of search (social, email, phone)
 * @returns Sanitized query string
 * @throws {ValidationError} If query format is invalid
 */
export const sanitizeSearchQuery = (
  query: string,
  type: SearchType
): string => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Documentation Updates
When adding features, update:
- README.md (if user-facing)
- TODO.md (mark as complete)
- CHANGELOG.md (for releases)
- Inline comments (for complex code)
- Type definitions (for APIs)

---

## üí¨ Communication

### Channels
- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **Pull Requests**: Code review and discussion
- **Private Messages**: Security issues and sensitive topics
- **Team Chat**: Daily communication (if applicable)

### Best Practices
- **Be clear and concise**
- **Provide context** in discussions
- **Ask questions** when unsure
- **Share knowledge** with the team
- **Update status** on assigned tasks
- **Respond promptly** to feedback

### Getting Help
- Review documentation first
